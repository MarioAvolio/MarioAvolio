# üëã Hi, I'm Mario Avolio

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I'm a Computer Science graduate with a strong passion for **Computer Vision**, **Robotics**, and **Natural Language Processing**. Currently pursuing my Master's degree at the University of Milano Bicocca, I focus on advanced topics like **Self-Supervised Learning** and **Model Adaptation** in the field of **Facial Attribute Classification**.

During my academic journey, I developed robust projects like **BrainyBot**, a robotic system that autonomously solves complex mobile games using **Answer Set Programming** and **Object Recognition**. This work has been recognized with awards and research publications in conferences such as KR2023, where I co-authored a paper exploring the interaction of robots with mobile games through hybrid AI techniques.
